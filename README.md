## Security Note

This application saves passwords in plain text. It is advisable to use it only for personal or non-critical data. For a more secure implementation, consider using encryption techniques.

## Customization

- **File Paths:** Modify the `TODO_FILE`, `JSON_FILE`, and `CSV_FILE` variables to change the default storage and export locations.
